# cardisabler
Well everyone, I cannot seem to figure out how to get the cardisabler script to work perfectly, as of right now what this script does is it locks all cars, any EMS/Military/PD car will bring up a message saying "Lockpicking the Car is against Server Rules" The problems with this script is that you must lockpick your own personal car. If you wish to edit it please PM me, and maybe we can work on it together and update  the script.
