# ESX_LOCKPICK
V 1.01 
Should now let you access your owned cars.

Well everyone, I cannot seem to figure out how to get the cardisabler script to work perfectly, as of right now what this script does is it locks all cars, any EMS/Military/PD car will bring up a message saying "Lockpicking the Car is against Server Rules" The problems with this script is that you must lockpick your own personal car. If you wish to edit it please PM me, and maybe we can work on it together and update  the script. Many possiblities with this script, I believe you just need a server sided script that searches the DB for owned cars and if that car is an owned car keep the vehicle unlock in the client script. Additionally, the script needs to have Police cars able to be unlocked if job is police. Feel free to PM me if you want to help me add these things  into the script and we can co-release!

Kinda got bored of this, feel free to do whatever you want with this, I am no longer updating it, not even sure if the current state works. Feel free to use my code for help though.
